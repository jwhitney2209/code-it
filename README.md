  ## Description
  Code_It is a noting-taking app made especially for your code. When you create a note, you can add code snippets and personal notations. You can also edit, delete, and share them at any time. Create folders to set up an organized directory or keep your notes in a random, piled collection. This application was made with GraphQL, React, MongoDB, Express.js, TailwindCSS, and JSX.
